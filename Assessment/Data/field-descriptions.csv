Field name,Description
SITE_ID,The unique identifier used by Transport and Main Roads for the location that the traffic data is collected at. The is the physical location of a traffic counting device. Sites are located at a specified Through Distance along a Road Section. 
DESCRIPTION,The descriptive deatils of the physical location of the traffic counting device
SITE_DISTANCE,TDist or Through Distance, in kilometres, is the physical location of the traffic count site measured in kilometres from the beginning of the Road Section. 
LONGITUDE,Longitude of the location in decimal degrees (WGS Datum)
LATITUDE,Latitude of the location in decimal degrees (WGS Datum)
AADT,Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) is the number of vehicles passing a point on a road in a 24 hour period, averaged over a calendar year. This figure for short term counts is seasonally adjusted.
RSECT_ID,Is the Gazetted road from which the traffic data is collected. Each Road Section is given a code, allocated sequentially in Gazettal Direction. Larger roads are broken down into sections and identified by an ID code with a suffix for easier data collection and reporting (eg. 10A, 10B, 10C). Road Sections are then broken into AADT Segments which are determined by traffic volume.
ROAD_NAME,The name of a gazetted road section within a major road. For example, the Bruce Highway is identified by the number 10, an alpha suffix is added to indicate the Road Section "10A" being Bruce Highway (Brisbane-Gympie).
TDIST_START,Is the start through distance in kilomtres of the segment the site is attached to for the road section. 
TDIST_END,Is the end through distance in kilomtres of the segment the site is attached to for the road section.
GAZZETAL_DIRECTION,The Gazettal Direction is the direction of the traffic flow. It can be easily recognised by referring to the name of the road eg. Road Section: 10A Brisbane - Gympie this notes that the gazettal direction is from Brisbane to Gympie.
HOUR,Hour of the day for the traffic volume (data averaged over year).
"MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT,SUN", Day of week of the traffic volume (data averaged over year).
