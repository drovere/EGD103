If it is <strong>Code</strong>, that code is evaluated.  If it is <strong>Markdown</strong>, the text will be displayed according to the markup tags used to format the text. If it is <strong>Raw</strong>, the text will simply be displayed 'as is', ie as plain text.  Notice that, before execution, the contents of cells looks different depending on the selected <em>type</em>.\n",

    "You will see that this cell is Markdown, and it contains special markup 'tags' surrounding parts of the text to change the way it is displayed when executed.  To look at those tags, double click on any of the text here.  For example you will see how we have marked up the headings and the bulleted lists, and emphasised some words (with italics and bolding).  To render the cell as we intended, simply execute the cell again.\n",

Generally there will be some Python comments giving a brief introduction to the exercise, potentially followed by some code, then a description of the task you are to complete.  After writing your solution, execute the cell to evaluate your Python code.  Any result of evaluating your code will be displayed in a new cell below the code.  Anything printed will just appear at the bottom of the current cell.\n",
